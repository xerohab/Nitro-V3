# Octane

Octane originated as a fork of [Nitro React](https://github.com/billsonnn/nitro-react) and its companion [Nitro Renderer](https://github.com/billsonnn/nitro-renderer).

Since then, Octane has evolved beyond its origins. Both the client and renderer have been expanded, improved and maintained through numerous fixes and new features.

While Octane remains grateful to the Nitro project and its contributors, it is no longer intended to be a simple fork or reskin. It is an independently developed platform with its own identity, technical direction and long-term vision.

## Prerequisites

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18
    - If using NodeJS < 18 remove `--openssl-legacy-provider` from the package.json scripts
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) `npm i yarn -g`

## Quick install (recommended)

The repository ships a cross-platform installer that performs the full setup
in one go: prerequisites check, renderer clone & link, dependency install,
config copy, JSON parsing mode selection, URL prompt with validation, and the
production build.

After cloning Octane, from its root run:

```
# Windows
install.bat

# Linux / macOS
./install.sh
```

Both wrappers just exec `node install.mjs`, so you can also invoke it directly:

```
node install.mjs
```

The installer walks through these steps:

```
[1/9] Check prerequisites (node >= 18, yarn, git)
[2/9] Clone octane-renderer
[3/9] Setup renderer (yarn install + yarn link)
[4/9] Setup client (yarn install + yarn link "@nitrots/nitro-renderer")
[5/9] Copy public/configuration/*.example -> *.json
[6/9] Choose JSON parsing mode (jsonc recommended) -> writes .nitro-build.json
[7/9] Configure URLs (interactive, validated)
[8/9] Build (yarn build)
[9/9] Summary
```

### Headless / CI runs

Every step can be driven from flags so the installer can be used in pipelines:

```
node install.mjs --non-interactive \
    --json-mode=jsonc \
    --socket-url=wss://example.com/ws \
    --api-url=https://example.com \
    --asset-url=https://example.com/nitro-assets/ \
    --image-library-url=https://example.com/c_images \
    --hof-furni-url=https://example.com/hof_furni \
    --camera-url=https://example.com/camera \
    --thumbnails-url=https://example.com/thumbnails \
    --habbopages-url=/habbopages \
    --api-base-url=https://example.com \
    --plain-config-base-url=https://example.com/configuration \
    --plain-gamedata-base-url=https://example.com/gamedata \
    --skip-link
```

Useful workflow flags:

-   `--non-interactive` / `--skip-prompts` — keep example defaults unless a URL override is passed
-   `--json-mode=<jsonc\|legacy\|auto>` — pick the parser without the JSON mode prompt
-   `--skip-build`, `--skip-clone`, `--skip-link` — re-runs without redoing those steps
-   `--help` — full flag reference and per-key URL flags

`install.mjs` is idempotent: re-running it keeps any `*.json` config files
that already exist and only patches the URL keys you pass on the CLI.

## Splitting gamedata

The renderer can load gamedata files (FigureData, FurnitureData, FigureMap,
EffectMap, ProductData, HabboAvatarActions, ExternalTexts, UITexts) either as
a single legacy JSON/JSONC file or as a **directory of small files** organised
in three tiers: `core/` (vendor baseline), `custom/` (your additions / overrides),
`seasonal/` (date-bound content such as Christmas or Easter).

The split layout is much easier to maintain — you edit a small focused file
instead of a 43 MB FurnitureData.json — and lets you keep vendor and operator
content cleanly separated.

### Directory layout

```
nitro-assets/gamedata/furnidata/
  manifest.jsonc           # { "tiers": ["core", "custom", "seasonal"] }
  core/
    manifest.jsonc         # { "files": ["floor-001.jsonc", ..., "wall-001.jsonc"] }
    floor-001.jsonc
    floor-002.jsonc
    wall-001.jsonc
  custom/                  # OPTIONAL — created by you
    manifest.jsonc         # { "files": ["my-rares.jsonc"] }
    my-rares.jsonc
  seasonal/                # OPTIONAL — created by you
    manifest.jsonc
    xmas-2026.jsonc
```

Each tier is loaded in order. Within a tier, files load in the order listed in
its `manifest.jsonc`. Items in later layers override items in earlier layers
when they share the same identifier (`id`, `classname`, `name`, or the
top-level key for flat dictionaries).

### Generating the `core/` tier from a legacy file

Use the bundled CLI splitter:

```
node scripts/split-gamedata.mjs \
    --input ~/legacy-gamedata/FurnitureData.json \
    --output ~/nitro-assets/gamedata/furnidata
```

It auto-detects the gamedata type from the file's top-level keys and applies
the strategy that makes the most sense:

| Type                 | Split strategy                              |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| EffectMap            | one file per effect `type` (dance, fx, ...) |
| FigureData           | one `palettes.jsonc` + one file per setType |
| FigureMap            | chunks of `libraries` (default 500/file)    |
| FurnitureData        | floor / wall, chunks of `furnitype` (300)   |
| HabboAvatarActions   | grouped by `state` (or single file if ≤1)   |
| ProductData          | chunks of products (default 500)            |
| ExternalTexts/UITexts| grouped by key prefix (e.g. `gamecenter.*`) |

Useful flags: `--type=<name>` to force the type, `--chunk-size=N` to override
the default chunk size, `--json` to emit standard JSON instead of JSONC,
`--force` to overwrite an existing output directory. Full reference:

```
node scripts/split-gamedata.mjs --help
```

We only ship the `core/` tier with vendor baselines — `custom/` and `seasonal/`
are operator-owned: create their manifests when you need them and the loader
picks them up automatically.

### Pointing the renderer at a directory

In `public/configuration/renderer-config.json`, replace the legacy file URL
with the directory URL (note the trailing slash — that's how the loader
detects split mode):

```jsonc
{
  // single file (legacy, still supported):
  "furnidata.url": "https://example.com/nitro-assets/gamedata/FurnitureData.json",

  // directory (split mode):
  "furnidata.url": "https://example.com/nitro-assets/gamedata/furnidata/",
}
```

Both styles work; you can migrate one gamedata file at a time.

## Installation (manual)

-   First you should open terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to clone Octane and Octane Renderer
-   Clone Octane (Expl. C:\Github\)
  -   `git clone https://github.com/duckietm/Octane.git` <== For now switch to Dev-RendererV2
	-   `git clone https://github.com/duckietm/Octane-Renderer.git`
	-   Install the dependencies for the renderer : cd C:\Github\octane-renderer
    	-   `yarn install`
	-	Now we will create a Link for the Octane Renderer : `yarn link` This will give you a link address `yarn link "@nitrots/nitro-renderer"`
    -   Install the dependencies for Cool UI : cd C:\Github\octane
	-   `yarn install`
 -  -   Rename a few files
    -   Copy `public/configuration/renderer-config.example` to `public/configuration/renderer-config.json`
    -   Copy `public/configuration/ui-config.example` to `public/configuration/ui-config.json`
    -   Copy `public/configuration/client-mode.example` to `public/configuration/client-mode.json`
    -   Set your links
    -   Open `public/configuration/renderer-config.json`
        -   Update `socket.url, asset.url, image.library.url, & hof.furni.url`
    -   Open `public/configuration/ui-config.json`
        -   Update `camera.url, thumbnails.url, url.prefix, habbopages.url`
	-   `yarn build` <== the final step to build the DIST folder this is where your browser needs to point / or upload this to your /client if you do the compile on a other machine (preferd)
    -   You can override any variable by passing it to `NitroConfig` in the index.html

## JSON / JSONC configuration mode

Starting with this version of Octane, you can choose how the client parses the
configuration files (`renderer-config.json`, `ui-config.json`, `client-mode.json`,
and the gamedata JSONs served by the renderer):

-   **JSONC** (recommended) — accepts comments and trailing commas while still
    requiring double-quoted keys and strings. It is easier to maintain in `ui-config.json`
    where you may want inline notes.
-   **JSON (legacy strict)** — only valid standard JSON is accepted. Any comment
    or trailing comma will fail the load with a clear error.

### Picking a mode

The first time you run `yarn start` or `yarn build`, an interactive prompt asks
which mode to use:

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Octane — JSON mode configuration
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  1) JSONC  (recommended)
  2) JSON   (legacy strict)
  auto      Try strict JSON first, then JSONC

Choice [1=JSONC]:
```

Your choice is stored in `.nitro-build.json` at the project root (gitignored, so
each deployment keeps its own setting). Subsequent builds reuse it silently.

### Changing the mode later

Run the prompt again at any time:

```
yarn configure
```

You can also set the mode without interaction (useful in CI / scripts):

```
# one-shot override for a single build
NITRO_JSON_MODE=legacy yarn build
NITRO_JSON_MODE=jsonc  yarn build

# write the choice persistently
echo '{"jsonMode":"legacy"}' > .nitro-build.json
```

The recognized values are `legacy`, `jsonc`, and `auto` (auto = try strict JSON
first, fall back to JSONC — equivalent to the original Render V3 behaviour).

### How it propagates

The chosen mode is injected at build time as the compile-time constant
`__NITRO_JSON_MODE__`. It is honoured by:

-   `src/bootstrap.ts` when loading `client-mode.json`
-   `@nitrots/utils` → `JsonParser.ts` in Render V3, used for every config file
    and every gamedata JSON loaded by the renderer

In `legacy` mode, an invalid file produces a clear error that suggests switching
to JSONC; nothing is silently coerced.

## Usage

-   To use Octane you need `.nitro` assets generated, see [nitro-converter](https://git.krews.org/nitro/nitro-converter) for instructions
-   See [Morningstar Websockets](https://git.krews.org/nitro/ms-websockets) for instructions on configuring websockets on your server

### Development

Run Octane in development mode when you are editing the files, this way you can see the changes in your browser instantly

```
yarn start
```

### Production

To build a production version of Octane just run the following command

```
yarn build:prod
```

-   A `dist` folder will be generated, these are the files that must be uploaded to your webserver
-   Consult your CMS documentation for compatibility with Octane and how to add the production files
